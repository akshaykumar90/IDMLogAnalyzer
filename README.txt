IDMLogAnalyzer

This simple python program collects information about your IDM usage through the log files. It then presents the data in a graphical interface.

Apparently, IDM version >= 6 deletes the logfile automatically after the download is complete, rendering this program helpless. No data means no analysis. You can still use it with IDM version below 6.

Happy Analyzing!!!
